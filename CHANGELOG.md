## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.11] — 2026-05-04

### Added
- `wyoming_hailo_whisper`: `--corrections-file` CLI argument accepts a path to a JSON file containing `[pattern, replacement]` pairs (regex, implicit `IGNORECASE`). Corrections are loaded at startup and applied after each transcription. Built-in corrections remain the default when no file is provided.
- `wyoming_hailo_whisper/corrections.json`: sample corrections file shipped with the module, pre-populated with the built-in correction rules, ready to copy to the Pi and edit without rebuilding the image.
- `wyoming_hailo_whisper`: raw-transcript logging with per-utterance HA success/failure outcome. When `WHISPER_RAW_LOG` env var is set, every utterance is appended to a TSV file (`timestamp\traw\tcorrected\tresponse_type\tdetail`). The HA `/api/conversation/process` call runs in a background asyncio task so it never adds latency to the voice pipeline. Requires `HA_TOKEN`; `HA_URL` defaults to `http://host.docker.internal:8123`.

---

## [1.0.9] — 2026-05-02

### Added
- `hailo_ollama_proxy`: single retry on tool-call validation rejection. When the model emits a JSON-shaped tool call that fails validation (empty list, hallucinated `entity_id`, missing `domain`/`service`), the proxy resends the same request once with `temperature=0.7` and `top_p=0.95` to perturb sampling. The first failure is often a deterministic mistake — qwen2.5:1.5b at the default `temperature=0.1` HA sends will keep picking the same wrong Zigbee-style id; a higher-temperature retry breaks the pattern. Costs ~one extra inference (~10-15s) on failed first attempts only; successful first attempts are unaffected. Live test on the Pi recovered "turn on the office lights" (was hallucinating a non-existent Zigbee-style entity_id).
- `--no-retry-on-rejection` CLI flag (default: retry enabled). Use it to opt out if the latency hit on failures matters more than the accuracy gain.
- `voice-test.sh`: repeatable smoke-test script that sends a list of voice commands through HA's `/api/conversation/process` and reports each spoken reply with ✔/⊘/✘ verdicts plus wall-clock duration. Replaces the ad-hoc curl loops we'd been pasting into the shell. Supports `-f FILE`, `--interval N`, `--log` (dumps proxy markers), and ad-hoc commands as positional args.
- `README.md`: new "Testing voice commands" section documenting `voice-test.sh` usage and env vars.
- `.claude/skills/voice-pr-flow/SKILL.md`: project-level Claude Code skill that codifies the live-test PR workflow established by PR #17 / #18 — sync local main, branch off main, build → wait for green → deploy → live-test against the deployed image with a side-by-side comparison vs. the most recent released `v1.0.x` baseline. Includes anti-patterns (skipping live test, reordering examples on instinct, deploying stale image, version-bumping in feature branch).
- `.gitignore`: excludes per-machine Claude Code state (`.claude/scheduled_tasks.lock`, `.claude/settings.local.json`) while keeping `.claude/skills/` tracked.

### Changed
- `rewrite_tool_response` now returns `(body, status)` where `status ∈ {'tool_call', 'rejected', 'pass_through'}` so the request layer can decide whether to retry. No behaviour change when retry is disabled.
- `Handler._send_to_backend` extracted from `_forward` so the retry path doesn't duplicate request-building / header forwarding logic.
- Proxy startup log shows `retry-on-rejection=off` when disabled (omitted when default-on, to keep the line readable).

## [1.0.8] — 2026-05-02

### Changed
- Injected tool call examples reordered: dim (with `brightness_pct`) is now first so the model pattern-matches against it for brightness commands
- Added `turn off` as a third injected example — model was using `turn_on` for all commands including off requests
- Tool injection on tool-result follow-up turns now skips the JSON-only example block and asks for a one-sentence natural-language confirmation instead. Previously the model parroted JSON back after every successful action, validation rejected it as `{"list":[{}]}`, and HA's TTS read the raw JSON aloud
- System prompt rules tightened: explicit instructions against repeating `service_data` and against appending the friendly-name suffix to `entity_id`
- Brightness commands: added explicit rule banning `brightness` (no `_pct`), `value`, and the invented service name `set_brightness_pct`; expanded examples to cover "set to N%", "at N%", "brighter", "darker" alongside "dim"
- One-action-per-list rule added — model was emitting `turn_on + turn_off` pairs that cancelled each other for some dim phrasings
- Follow-up reply hint hardened: "EXACTLY ONE short sentence about ONLY the device the user asked about, do not invent details" — model was listing unrelated entities and fabricating brightness values in the spoken summary
- Proxy-side normalisation of model output (qwen2.5:1.5b ignores rules even after the prompt is tightened):
  - Service name aliases: `set_brightness`, `set_brightness_pct`, `set_brightness_level`, `dim`, `brighten`, `darken` → `turn_on`
  - Argument-key aliases: `value`, `new_value`, `new_level`, `brightness`, `level`, `dim_level`, `percent`, `pct` → `brightness_pct`
  - Item-level `brightness_pct` (sibling of `service_data`) is moved INTO `service_data` so HA actually applies it
  - Brightness values > 100 are rescaled from the 0-255 range to 0-100
  - List entries targeting the same `(domain, entity_id)` are merged so a plain `turn_on` plus a `turn_on`-with-brightness collapse into one well-formed call
  - A `turn_off` of an entity that was just `turn_on`'d in the same call is dropped (self-cancelling pair)
  - Cross-entity brightness rescue: when the model puts the user-intended action on entity A and a brightness on entity B (e.g. accidentally targeting `light.0x...,Guest Room Stand Light`), the brightness is copied onto A and the second item is dropped — observed as the dominant failure mode for "dim/set/at N%" phrasings on qwen2.5:1.5b
  - Multi-distinct-entity drop: when more than one distinct `entity_id` remains after coalesce, only the first item is kept. Project scope is single-device commands and the second entity has consistently been bogus in observed traffic
- Follow-up reply truncated to the first sentence — kills the multi-paragraph hallucinated entity roll-call ("the main bedroom lights remained off, the table lights were turned off, …") that came after an otherwise correct opening sentence
- Follow-up reply also blanked when the model emits a JSON tool-call shape (e.g. `{"list":[]}`) instead of natural language; previously the JSON was read aloud
- Entity-id allowlist: the proxy scrapes HA's "Available Devices" list from the request system prompt and rejects any tool call whose `entity_id` is not in that set. Hallucinated ids no longer reach HA; the response falls through to silent JSON-blanking instead of speaking an HA `Unable to find entity` error
- Example ordering kept brightness-first (kept after a reorder experiment): putting plain `turn on` / `turn off` at the top of the example list was tried as a fix for the on/off entity hallucination but regressed dim accuracy from 6/8 to 3/8 without fixing the hallucination. The original brightness-first order is more accuracy-sensitive overall

### Fixed
- `hailo_ollama_proxy`: stray trailing `"` appended by the model to its JSON output (e.g. `{...}}"`) caused `json.loads` to fail and the tool call rewrite to fall through to plain text; `_fix_json` now strips leading/trailing quote characters before any parse attempt
- `hailo_ollama_proxy`: model output with two `service_data` keys in one service entry (e.g. `entity_id` in one, `brightness_pct` in the next) lost the `entity_id` after parsing; new `_merge_duplicate_service_data` pre-pass merges them before `json.loads`
- `hailo_ollama_proxy`: `entity_id` values copied from HA's CSV-formatted entity list with a `,Friendly Name` suffix (e.g. `light.0x001788...,Guest Room Light`) are now stripped to the bare dotted id before validation
- `hailo_ollama_proxy`: when a JSON-shaped response fails tool-call validation or cannot be parsed at all, `content` is now blanked to `""` instead of being passed through verbatim, so HA's TTS no longer reads raw JSON aloud as the spoken reply

---

## [1.0.7] — 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- `hailo_ollama_proxy`: broken service calls no longer reach Home Assistant when the model generates structurally valid but empty tool arguments (e.g. `{"list": [{}]}`); proxy now validates that each `execute_services` list item has `domain`, `service`, and `service_data.entity_id` before rewriting to `tool_calls` format — invalid calls are logged and returned as plain text instead

### Changed
- Injected tool call example expanded from one (turn on) to two (turn on + dim to 30%) to give the model a better template for brightness commands

---

## [1.0.6] — 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- `hailo_ollama_proxy`: null-pointer crash (HTTP 500) when Home Assistant sends back conversation history after a tool call
  - After the proxy rewrites a response into `tool_calls` format, HA echoes the history back with `{"role": "assistant", "content": null, "tool_calls": [...]}` and `{"role": "tool", ...}` messages; hailo-ollama (oatpp/C++) dereferences `content` as `std::string` and crashes on null
  - Added `sanitize_conversation_roles()` to the request pipeline: converts `assistant+tool_calls+null content` to a plain assistant message with the tool call serialised as JSON text, and `role:tool` to a `role:user` message with the result

---

## [1.0.5] — 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- `hailo_ollama_proxy`: tool call JSON truncated at token limit, producing unparseable output (e.g. missing final `}`)
  - `inject_tool_prompt` now raises `max_tokens` to at least 250 when tools are present — a pretty-printed single-service call is ~150-200 tokens and the previous 119-120 cap was cutting output mid-JSON
  - `inject_defaults` no longer clamps `max_tokens` values ≤ 500; only pathologically high values (HA default: 1022) are clamped, preserving the 250 set by `inject_tool_prompt`
  - `_fix_json` now balances unmatched braces/brackets as a safety net, handling any future truncation that slips through

---

## [1.0.4] — 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- `hailo_ollama_proxy`: model JSON output with trailing commas (e.g. `[{...},]`) now parsed correctly — common LLM artifact that caused `rewrite_tool_response` to silently fall back to plain text, preventing Home Assistant from receiving the tool call
- Added `_fix_json()` helper that strips trailing commas before `]`/`}` and markdown fences; applied to all parse paths in `_try_parse_tool_call`

---

## [1.0.3] — 2026-05-01

### Added
- `hailo_ollama_proxy`: tool call emulation layer (hailo-tools-v1)
  - **Request side** (`inject_tool_prompt`): detects `tools[]` in the request, injects a strict single-line JSON output instruction and a concrete `execute_services` example into the system message, then strips `tools`/`tool_choice` before forwarding — hailo-ollama does not implement the OpenAI tool calling spec and would ignore or reject these fields
  - **Response side** (`rewrite_tool_response`): parses the model's plain-text output and rewrites it into the OpenAI `tool_calls` format Home Assistant expects (`finish_reason: "tool_calls"`, `content: null`); handles `{name, arguments}` objects, bare `{list:[]}` arguments, `func({})` call notation, and markdown-fenced JSON; falls back to the original plain-text response if no tool call is detected

---

## [1.0.2] — 2026-05-01

### Added
- `hailo_ollama_proxy`: single `--log-level info|debug|trace` arg (env: `PROXY_LOG_LEVEL`) replaces separate `--debug` / `--trace` flags
  - `info` — startup banner only (default)
  - `debug` — log every request and response body; system prompt truncated to 200 chars
  - `trace` — like debug but full bodies with no truncation; use when inspecting the full HA system prompt or entity list
- Truncation hint in debug mode shows how many chars were cut and suggests `--log-level trace`

---

## [1.0.1] — 2026-05-01

### Added
- `hailo_ollama_proxy`: all inference thresholds now configurable via CLI args — `--max-tokens`, `--num-predict`, `--num-ctx`, `--temperature`, `--top-p`, `--listen-port`, `--backend-port`
- Proxy startup log now prints the active config for easy verification via `docker logs hailo-ollama`

### Fixed
- `/v1/chat/completions` path (used by Home Assistant) was not receiving `num_ctx` injection — context window was unconstrained on every HA voice request
- Raised `num_ctx` default from 512 to 1024 to accommodate the HA system prompt + entity list without truncation
- `num_predict` cap now applies as a hard ceiling on native API paths (previously only injected when missing, not when caller sent a higher value)

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-01

### Added
